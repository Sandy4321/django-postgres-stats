   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Django Postgres Power's documentation!
=================================================

Postgres Power exposes functions specific to Postgres to Django without
making the user write raw SQL. The plan is to expand the library over time
to cover all Postgres-specific functions. For now, only functions personally
used by the authors have been added.

Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   installation
   functions



Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`search`
